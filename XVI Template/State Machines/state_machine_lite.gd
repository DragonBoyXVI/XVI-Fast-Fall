## A [RefCounted] based state machine.
##
## This is basically a wrapper for "match" based state machines.
## This also emits signals whenever its state is changed


## Emitted when you set the "state" value
signal state_entered( state: int );
## Emitted before the state value is changed
signal state_left( state: int );


var state: int = 0:
	set( new ):
		
		state_left.emit( state );
		state = new;
		state_entered.emit( new );
